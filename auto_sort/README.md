# Introduction
`asort.py` is a very simple python3 script that aims to make sure items in the README file of the repo [Awesome-Linux-Software](https://github.com/VoLuong/Awesome-Linux-Software) are sorted alphabetically.

This script only sorts items in the following topics for now (items between topic Applications and topic Setup):
- Applications
- Command Line Utilities
- Desktop Environments
- Display Managers
- Window Managers

# Usage
1. Add items to corresponding topics, don't worry about the order of those items.
1. Make sure you've installed python3 environment on your system.
1. Open a terminal, type `python3 asort.py` to run this script. After that, you'll get a new README file with all the items in the above topics being sorted alphabetically.
